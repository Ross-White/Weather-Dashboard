# Weather-Dashboard

## My Task

My challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

I will use the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities, as well as `localStorage` to store any persistent data.

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```

## Implementation

During the development of the app, used used a variety of technologies:
* Vanilla Javascript
    * I mostly used vanilla Javascript, as I wanted to challenge myself to fully understand to language.
* JQuery
    * In some areas I chose to use JQuery for more concise code.
* CSS
    * CSS was used to add custom styles on top of the Bootstrap framework.
* Bootstrap
    * I used Bootstrap to quickly and easily create the basic page structure, and to become more familiar with using CSS frameworks.
* Moment.js
